# GameOff21

This repository is for my submission to GitHub's GameOff 2021.

This is my first submission to any game jam and my first foray into indie development since I was a child. I plan to use PhaserJS as I'm more comfortable with JavaScript as a language and would like to have something completed enough to submit even with the lengthy 30 days given.

This years theme is: Bug.

We're given pretty free reign to interpret that as we wish, see more on the [Jam's itch.io page](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021).
